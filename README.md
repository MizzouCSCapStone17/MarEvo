# MarEvo
A Super Mario Bros. machine learning approach using neuroevolution. Implemented by Aren Wells, Matt Huraza, and Trenton Thompson.

## TODO:
- Restructure some code and re-analyze portions (primarily network and cmaes)
  - Improve learning speed -> gotta beat 36 gens!
  - Improve Fitness score
  - Improve decision making
  - Use all outputs
- Display neural network on GUI
- Files for saving and importing. (Look at MarI/O)
  - Create and save after every generation
- Improve setup script and documentation
- Lots of tests and training! More data, more better
  - Generate graphs (preferably real-time) and tables
  - Record movies of training
